## Lura

Incremental/single-pass based compiler, the API can be either used for Single-Pass Compiling and for building LSP, or
things that would need incremental pipelines. It's a study project of mine for studying incremental compilers and
package-managers.

The project is still being developed, and the table of contents is:

- [Garbage Collection](#garbage-collection)
- [License](#license)

The objective of this project is:

- Dealing with language-servers, and direct support for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Having a full-featured CLI for building, and packaging libraries for Lura
- Lowering to [LLVM-IR](https://llvm.org/), and executing JIT
- Error-resistant compiler, like having a compile-time error, and still can compile, because the error fall onto the
  runtime
- Interpreter for basic things like macro-expanding.
- Query-based architecture.

It's all based on the works:

And have some great inspirations in [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer) code-base..

### Running

Clone the repository with `git submodule update --recursive --remote`

### Garbage-Collection

The goal of this compiler isn't optimizing things, it's more like an IDE, so the garbage collector is based on Reference
Counting.

### License

Lura is distributed under the terms of the [MIT license](LICENSE).
